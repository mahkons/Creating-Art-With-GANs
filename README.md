# Creating-Art-With-GANs

An implementation of [Cycle-GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) with three different experiments

Cycle-GAN is a model which is used for style transfer. Having objects of two different classes Cycle-GAN learns a translation from one class to another.

* Pictures (Kaggle dataset, transforming photos to the style of Monet pictures)

* Music (Described in MusicExperiment.md in more details)
* RL (Transforming style of states, sampled from environment, to Monet style and after that extending the dataset with these examples)
